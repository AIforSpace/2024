        <p>
            The space sector is experiencing significant growth. Currently planned activities and utilisation models also greatly exceed the scope, ambition and/or commercial value of space missions in the previous century, e.g., autonomous spacecraft, space mining, and understanding the universe. Achieving these ambitious goals requires surmounting non-trivial technical obstacles. AI4Space focuses on the role of AI, particularly computer vision and machine learning, in helping to solve those technical hurdles. The workshop will highlight the space capabilities that draw from and/or overlap significantly with vision and learning research, outline the unique difficulties presented by space applications to vision and learning, and discuss recent advances towards overcoming those obstacles.

      <b><a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/team/shirley-ho/">Shirley Ho</a></b> is Leader of the Cosmology X Data Science group at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA), Flatiron Institute. Her research interests range from fundamental cosmological measurements to exoplanet statistics to using machine learning to estimate how much dark matter is in the universe. Her goal is to understand the universe’s beginning, evolution and its ultimate fate. Recently she has been developing novel tools using machine learning to solve astrophysical challenges. Shirley plans, builds and analyzes data from a number of astronomical surveys such as Actacama Cosmology Telescope, Euclid, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Simons Observatory, Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. She has broad expertise in theory, observation and data science, and her significant experience on machine learning for cosmology will deliver plenty of insights to the CVPR audience. Shirley earned her Ph.D. in astrophysical sciences from Princeton in 2008 and her bachelor’s degrees in computer science and physics from the UC Berkeley in 2004. She was a Chamberlain fellow and a Seaborg fellow at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory before joining CMU in 2011 as an assistant professor. She became the Cooper Siegel Career Development Chair Professor and was appointed associate professor with tenure in 2016. She moved to Lawrence Berkeley Lab as a Senior Scientist in 2016. Since 2011, she has been a primary mentor to more than 25 postdoctoral fellows, seven graduate students and 20 undergraduates.

    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-xs-12">
    <p>
      We solicit papers for AI4Space. Papers will be fully peer reviewed, and accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of CVPR Workshops. Authors of accepted papers will also be invited to present at the workshop at CVPR 2021 (virtual).
      </p>
      <p>
      The general emphasis of AI4Space is vision and learning algorithms in off-Earth environments, including in the orbital region, surface and underground environments on other planetary bodies (e.g., the moon, Mars and asteroids), interplanetary space and solar system, and distant galaxies. Target application areas include autonomous spacecraft, space robotics, space traffic management, astronomy, astrobiology and cosmology. Emphasis is also placed on novel sensors and processing hardware for vision and learning in space, mitigating the challenges of the space environment towards vision and learning (e.g., solar radiation, extreme temperatures), and solving practical difficulties in vision and learning for space (e.g., lack of training data, unknown or partially known characteristics of operating environments).
    </p>
    <p>
    A specific list of topics is as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Visual navigation for spacecraft operations (including close proximity rendezvous, docking, space maneuvers, pose estimation, entry descent landing)</li>
      <li>Vision and learning for space robotics</li>
      <li>Positioning, mapping and SLAM for the moon and Mars</li>
      <li>Autonomous celestial positioning</li>
      <li>Space debris monitoring and mitigation</li>
      <li>Vision and learning for astronomy, astrobiology and cosmology</li>
      <li>Sensors for space applications (e.g., optical, multispectral, lidar, radar, event-based)</li>
      <li>AI and learning-based satellite communications and IoT</li>
      <li>Processing hardware for vision and learning in space, including satellite on-board processing</li>
      <li>Mitigating challenges of the space environment to vision and learning</li>
      <li>Datasets, transfer learning and domain gap for space problems</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        At <a href="https://www.draper.com/">Draper</a>, we believe exciting things happen when we combine our diverse disciplines to imagine and create new solutions. From whiteboard concept to fielded systems, Draper engineers design, develop and deploy advanced technology solutions for the world’s most difficult and important problems. More than a thousand engineers and scientists — experts in fields ranging from GN&C to microfabrication — bring a multidisciplinary advantage to system design. The breadth and depth of our expertise enable us to take on almost any challenge. By building and field-testing working prototypes we accelerate design iterations. We can complete small production runs, license our intellectual property and transition technology for large-volume production. We provide full life-cycle support, including technology refresh. We provide engineering services directly to government, commercial companies and academia; work on teams as prime contractor or subcontractor; and participate as a collaborator in consortia. As a not-for-profit engineering innovation company, we provide unbiased assessments of technology or systems designed or recommended by other organizations — whether custom-designed or commercial-off-the-shelf.
